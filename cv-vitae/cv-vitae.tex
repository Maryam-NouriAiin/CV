\quote{Genomic epidemiologist with expertise in population genetics,
bioinformatics, and epidemiology. I'm interested in combining these
approaches to population-based studies of infectious diseases,
particularly malaria, and more recently COVID-19. My work has involved
international collaborations in West Africa, Asia-Pacific and the
Americas, and spans applied epidemiology and capacity-building in the
field, to genetics and genomics in the lab, to the downstream analytics
using advanced approaches and digital tools. I am an avid \texttt{R}
user for data processing, visualization, communication,
reports/dashboards, shiny web applications and am passionate about open
science and the development of digital tools for research.}

For other non-traditional academic contributions, I have also developed
several \texttt{R\ Shiny} web applications to support COVID-19
surveillance efforts and \texttt{R\ flexdashboard} for real-time updates
and data visualization of both programmatic/operational aspects and
preliminary epidemiological trends as part of the coordination of
population-based field studies.
